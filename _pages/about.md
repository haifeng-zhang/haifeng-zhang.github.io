I am a postdoc fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by Dr. Yuqing (Ching) Ren and Dr. Robert E. Kraut. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik in August 2017. My research focuses on the design and management of complex dynamic systems where individual decisions are influenced by social, economic and technical factors and in turn influence the design and development of these systems. In particular, I have examined the dynamic interplay and co-evolution humans and artifacts or machines in two domains: online open collaborations like Wikipedia and technological innovations like solar panel markets. I employ a wide variety of methods such as machine learning, econometrics, agent-based modeling and algorithmic optimization in my research.
