I am a postdoc fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute ([HCII](https://hcii.cmu.edu/)) at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by [Dr. Robert E. Kraut](http://kraut.hciresearch.org/) and [Dr. Yuqing (Ching) Ren](http://www.chingren.com/). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of [Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/) in August 2017. I am on the job market this year! 

My research develops computing methods and techniques to help the ​growth of socio-technical systems, where human actors interact with other agents, artifacts and technologies. Two such systems that I have studied include the world's largest online open collaboration community, ​Wikipedia and the US's leading residential solar market, ​California . In general, I am interested to study two types of research questions. First, ​how do these systems work​? To answer the question, I often apply machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and econometrics to mine, predict and model individual behaviors and system dynamics. Second, ​how to sustain the growth of these systems​? To tackle the problem, I design efficient algorithms and intelligent systems to compute and execute promotional strategies.
