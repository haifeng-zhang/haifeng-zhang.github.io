I am a postdoc fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute ([HCII](https://hcii.cmu.edu/)) at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by [Dr. Yuqing (Ching) Ren](http://www.chingren.com/) and [Dr. Robert E. Kraut](http://kraut.hciresearch.org/). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of [Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/) in August 2017. I am now on job market and looking for a tenure-track position of Assistant Professor in *Information Systems* or *Information Science* starting Fall 2019!

I study complex dynamic systems where human decisions are influenced by social, economic and technical factors and in turn shape the design and evolution of the systems. Two domains that I have examined are online open collaborations like *Wikipedia* and technological innovations like *solar panel markets*. I have combined advanced computational methods including *machine learning*, *econometrics*, *agent-based modeling* and *algorithmic optimization* in studying these systems. My work aims to advance our knowledge of the complex interactions between human actors and artifacts or machines in complex sociotechnical systems, and make better predictions on how they evolve over time, and to inform the design and management of these systems.

## Research Interests
Complex sociotechnical systems, online communities, human-computer interaction, innovation diffusion, algorithmic marketing, machine learning, agent-based modeling

## Teaching Interest
Big data analytics, database and data modeling, object-oriented programming, developing applications for mobile, web and game, machine learning, modeling sociotechnical systems and innovation diffusion
