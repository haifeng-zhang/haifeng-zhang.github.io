I am a postdoc fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute ([HCII](https://hcii.cmu.edu/)) at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by [Dr. Yuqing (Ching) Ren](http://www.chingren.com/) and [Dr. Robert E. Kraut](http://kraut.hciresearch.org/). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of [Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/) in August 2017. I am now on job market and looking for a tenure-track position of Assistant Professor in either Information Systems or Computer Science starting Fall 2019!

I study complex dynamic systems where human decisions are influenced by social, economic and technical factors and in turn shape the design and evolution of the systems. Two domains that I have examined are online open collaborations like Wikipedia and technological innovations like solar panel markets. In open collaborations, users and artifacts interplay and coevolve. In technological innovations, consumers' adoption decisions depend on many factors such as social influence and economic incentives. I have combined advanced computational methods including machine learning, econometrics, agent-based modeling and algorithmic optimization in studying these systems. My work aims to advance our knowledge of the complex interactions between human actors and artifacts or machines in complex sociotechnical systems, and make better predictions on how they evolve over time, and to inform the design and management of these systems.
